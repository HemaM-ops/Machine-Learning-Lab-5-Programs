A1. Please evaluate confusion matrix for your classification problem. From confusion matrix, the other performance metrics such as precision, recall and F1-Score measures for both training and test data. Based on your observations, infer the models learning outcome (underfit / regularfit / overfit).

A2. Calculate MSE, RMSE, MAPE and R2 scores for the price predictionexercise done in Lab 03. Analyse the results.

A3. Generate 20 data points(training set data)consisting of 2 features(X & Y)whose values vary randomlybetween 1 & 10. Basedon the values, assign these 20 points to 2 differentclasses(class0-Blue& class1–Red).Make a scatter plot of the training data and color the points as per their class color.Observe the plot.

A4. Generate test set data with values of X & Y varying between 0 and 10 with increments of 0.1. This createsa test set of about 10,000 points. Classify these points with above training datausing kNN classifier (k = 3). Make a scatter plot of the test data output with test points colored as per their predicted class colors(all points predicted class0 are labeled blue color). Observe the color spread and class boundarylines in the feature space.

A5. Repeat A4 exercise for various values of k and observe the change in the class boundary lines.

A6. Repeat the exercises A3 to A5 for yourproject data consideringany two features and classes.

A7. Use RandomSearchCV()or GridSearchCV()operations to find the ideal ‘k’value for your kNN classifier. This is called hyper-parameter tuning
